# Conda recipes

This repository contains conda recipes for building some *common/useful* libraries, which are 
otherwise unavailable or unmaintained by popular conda channels. These are built automatically 
via CI services like [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) and [AppVeyor](https://www.appveyor.com/).

The recipes for different libraries/tools are stored in their **seperate branches**.
